# Indian Election 2024 Tweet Sentiment Analysis

This project performs a sentiment analysis of tweets related to the **2024 Indian general elections** using deep learning, machine learning, and NLP. By analyzing real-time data from Twitter for the 2024 elections and comparing it with sentiment data from the 2019 election, this project aims to identify trends in public opinion, assess party support, and analyze the emotions expressed in tweets. The project makes use of **Python**, **NLTK**, **deep learning models**, and **machine learning techniques** for sentiment classification.

## Objectives

1. **2024 Election Sentiment Analysis**: 
   - Collect tweets about the 2024 Indian elections using Selenium.
   - Process these tweets with Python NLP libraries (such as NLTK) to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
   
2. **Comparison with 2019 Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Use historical tweets from the 2019 elections available on **Kaggle** for comparison.
   - Analyze changes in public sentiment from 2019 to 2024, providing insights into shifts in political discourse and voter sentiment.

3. **Party Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**:
   - Predict which parties are gaining or losing popularity based on sentiment analysis.
   - Analyze the types of emotions (happiness, anger, fear, etc.) expressed in tweets, understanding the emotional drivers of voter opinions.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Python**: For data collection, analysis, and modeling.
- **Selenium**: For real-time scraping of tweets related to the 2024 Indian elections.
- **NLTK**: For NLP preprocessing tasks like tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Use RNN, LSTM, or transformer models for sentiment classification.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language ToolKit
- **Datasets**:
  - **2024 Tweets**: Collected in real-time using Selenium.
  - **2019 Tweets**: Historical data from Kaggle.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Scrape tweets for the 2024 election using Selenium.
   - Obtain 2019 election tweets from Kaggle.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess text data using NLTK.
   - Tokenize, remove stop words, and prepare datasets for model input.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Train machine learning and deep learning models on the datasets to classify tweet sentiments.
   - Fine-tune models for optimal accuracy and performance.

4. **Analysis & Results**:
   - Analyze sentiment trends for each political party in 2024.
   - Compare 2019 and 2024 results to identify shifts in public opinion.
   - Visualize emotions in tweets to understand the general mood and factors influencing sentiment.

## Expected Outcome

The project will deliver insights into:
- **Public Sentiment Trends**: A breakdown of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments by political party for the 2024 election.
- **Comparison with 2019**: Understanding how political sentiments have shifted over the past five years.
- **Emotion Analysis**: Insights into the emotions (e.g., joy, anger, fear) that drive voter opinions, helping to predict public support for various parties.

This analysis can serve as a valuable resource for political analysts, journalists, and parties seeking to understand voter sentiment and the changing dynamics of Indian politics.
